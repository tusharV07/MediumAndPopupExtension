This extension works with toggle, and does not trigger with the page load. To trigger the extension, user needs to toggle it. Removed run on load functionality as this is not fine tuned, so it removes essential classes or attributes too.

This extension is developed to remove the popups and overlays mostly related to paywalls, remove adblocker, signup interventions on the articles/blogs. Works good for single page websites.

This extension also redirects the medium articles links to freedium which provides the specified medium article content without the paywall.
